# CounterForGames
A useful score counter for a variety of 2-player games.

A convenient mini-application for keeping score in two-player games. The application allows players to change their scores individually and together. You can also reset the points count.

The work is done on hooks.
Made using custom CSS animations for the app wrapper frame.
